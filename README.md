# Discovering-Alternative-Predictors-for-Diabetes-Diagnosis

1. Please check out the diabetes dataset.  Label y is in the last column 'class'
2. Please review and debug the code.  The neural net section needs X and y from the PCA section
3. Please run and debug all sections.  Feel free to change as needed.
4. Note that I broke out hyperparameters for each model for easy tuning
